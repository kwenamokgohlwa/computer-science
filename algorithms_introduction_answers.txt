What makes an algorithm efficient is the amount of computational resources it uses. To determine efficiency we need to first determine the measure of efficiency e.g. speed, memory usage, performance benchmarks. So an efficient algorithm is when its resource consumption is at or below some acceptable level i.e. it will run at a reasonable amount of time. An inefficient algorithm is one that consumes more that the acceptable level and runs longer than a reasonable amount of time.
