1. A TSA officer searching each person at a boarding pass for a specific name that has been flagged as wanted who is due to fly.

2. Searching for a boarding gate at an airport.

3. 6 iterations.

4. 3 iterations.

5. I would choose a linear search because it would require me to first sort the million items then search them if I chose to binary search which would be a less efficient algorithm that uses more resources.

6. I would choose a binary search because the list is sorted and I wonâ€™t have to go through that first so using the more efficient binary search is a good case for this.

1. 
```
function searchDictionary (dictionary, word) {
	var low = 0;
	var high = dictionary.length;
	
	while (low <= high) {
		var mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
		if (dictionary[mid] > word) {
			high = mid - 1;
		} else if (dictionary[mid] < word) {
			low = mid + 1;
		} else {
			return mid;
		}
	}
	
	return "not found";
}
```

2.
```
function netGoldfish (fishTank, goldfish) {
	var result = null;
	for (var i = 0; i < fishTank.length; i++) {
		if (fishTank[i] === goldfish) {
			result = i;
			break
		}
	}
	return result;
}
